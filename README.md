# cst205_weather_project

Instruction for use as of 04/17/20

Makes use of three APIs, but only two need keys

Weather API, sign up at https://openweathermap.org/api for the "One Call API"

Zipcode API, sign up at https://www.zipcodeapi.com for the free usage plan

Assign these keys to their respective variable in configure.py for this project to work.

To run this Flask application, simpy run app.py in your terminal - no need to instantiate flask variables there

The back-end files will send three dictionaries, location, current_forcast, and daily_forcast to the front-end. 

The index.html file simply displays all data from every dictionary, icons are also provided from the API if the 
front-enders want to use them, to show the front-end developers how to access each element provided.
